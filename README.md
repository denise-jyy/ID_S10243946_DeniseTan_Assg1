Fluff & Buff specialises in pet grooming services. We also sell high quality grooming products and fun pet toys. We focus on maintaining a safe and pet-friendly environment that assures all pet parents that their pets are well taken care of.
 
## Design Process
 
The objective of this website is to provide customers with a platform to easily book appointments and buy pet products. Our main priority of the website is simplicity so that customers won't have a hard time navigating the website. We will also focus on the aesthetics on the website as it important to have a good first impression on potential customers and it also reflects our company's credibility. 

My website consists of 5 pages, Homepage (single scroll page), Booking page, Shop page, Checkout page and FAQs page. The homepage connects all the other pages. I also made two sets of wireframe, one for desktop view and another for mobile view. 

__Responsive Website__
This website will be able to adapt to whichever device our customer is using. This will improve their user experience.
__Easy navigation__
Include a navigation menu which is clearly labelled so customers will never have a problem finding their way through the website.
__Style and page layout__
Include pictures which will make the website less boring, texts that is easy to read and concise so we will not lose our customer's attention. Use of colour contrasts so all information displayed is clear. Layout should not be confusing.

-As a customer looking for pet products, I want to be able to quickly locate the type of products I'm interested in. This can be achieved by having organised sections for each type of product.

-As a customer who wants to book an appointment, I want to be able to fill in all the details without error. To do that, the website should have clear labels and a confirmation message.

-As a customer, I want to contact customer service. The website should have company details which are readable and easily located.
